   <p id="second_paragraph" class="class_paragraph" style="font-size:40px;">
      And now the STORM-BLAST came, and he
      Was tyrannous and strong:
      He struck with his o'ertaking wings,
      And chased us south along.

      With sloping masts and dipping prow,
      As who pursued with yell and blow
      Still treads the shadow of his foe,
      And forward bends his head,
      The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,
      And southward aye we fled.

   </p>
   <p id="second_paragraph" class="class_paragraph" style="font-size:40px;">
      And now there came both mist and snow,
      And it grew wondrous cold:
      And ice, mast-high, came floating by,
      As green as emerald.

      And through the drifts the snowy clifts
      Did send a dismal sheen:
      Nor shapes of men nor beasts we kenâ€”
      The ice was all between.

   </p>
   <p id="Third_paragraph" class="class_paragraph" style="font-size:40px;">
      The ice was here, the ice was there,
      The ice was all around:
      It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,
      Like noises in a swound!

      At length did cross an Albatross,
      Thorough the fog it came;
      As if it had been a Christian soul,
      We hailed it in God's name.

   </p>
   <p id="Fourth_paragraph" class="class_paragraph" style="font-size:40px;">
      It ate the food it ne'er had eat,
      And round and round it flew.
      The ice did split with a thunder-fit;
      The helmsman steered us through!

      And a good south wind sprung up behind;
      The Albatross did follow,
      And every day, for food or play,
      Came to the mariner's hollo!
